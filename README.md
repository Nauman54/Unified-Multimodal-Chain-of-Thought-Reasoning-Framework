# 📖 Overview

This repository presents a **Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Framework** that extends the original **Multimodal-CoT** architecture by integrating modern vision-language models, explainable AI techniques, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

The framework combines:

- 🖼️ Vision-Language Understanding
- 🧠 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- 🔍 Heuristic Answer Verification
- ✅ Rationale Consistency Validation
- 📚 Contextual Prompt Engineering
- ⚡ Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA)
- 💾 4-bit Quantization
- 📊 Explainable AI (XAI)

The proposed system is evaluated on **ScienceQA** and **A-OKVQA** benchmark datasets for scientific and commonsense visual reasoning.

---

# 🎯 Project Motivation

Large Vision-Language Models often generate plausible answers without verifying whether their reasoning is logically consistent.

This project addresses that challenge by introducing a reasoning-aware inference pipeline that:

- Generates intermediate reasoning
- Verifies answer confidence
- Validates rationale consistency
- Improves explainability
- Reduces hallucinations

Instead of directly predicting an answer, the framework reasons first and verifies the prediction before producing the final output.
